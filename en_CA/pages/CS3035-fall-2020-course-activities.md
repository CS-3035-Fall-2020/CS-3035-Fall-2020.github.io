## Pre-recorded lectures

Pre-recorded lectures and examples will be the main way that course content is delivered. These will be made available through links on Teams. There may be 3-5 pre-recorded lectures for each week, of 10-30 minutes in length that students should view.

On Teams a channel will be provided for each week of the course. For example, [Week 2] (https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aeab0b8e591da4608990558b1282614f3%40thread.tacv2/Week%25202%2520-%2520Sept%252014-18?groupId=eb132915-269f-4304-ad54-5938ab0608a5&tenantId=244e6ed2-339a-47f3-b95c-e45351c198b7). This will provide links to activities and content that should be reviewed during that week of the course, and that should be completed before the next week (i.e., lectures and content provided for Week 2 should be completed before the beginning of Week 3).

Assignments are larger and somewhat more challenging development tasks that aim to reinforce the theoretical topics in the course and give you hands on practical experience in developing graphical user interfaces. These are scheduled to be completed once every two weeks throughout the semester.

Assignments should be completed using the course software (Java 8, IntelliJ, Git) see [Working with Git for Assignment and Examples] for more details.

### Mini-Project

The mini-project will be announced in November and is meant to be a somewhat self-directed project. Criteria for assessment and example project ideas will be given.

The mini-project may be completed individually or in groups of two or three. Additional criteria or requirements will be provided for groups. Students will be responsible for find their own partners (a channel will be setup on Teams to assist).
